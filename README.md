# Interactive_Dashboard_Sales_Performance_Region_Wise
I’m super excited to share my latest creation—an Interactive Sales Performance Dashboard! 📍📊
This dashboard showcases:
 🔹 Top & Bottom 5 Sales Executives
 🔹 Target Achievement Leaders
 🔹 Target Deviation Insights
 🔹 Sleek visualizations like bar graphs, pie charts, and line trends—all dynamic and interactive!
Thanks to the insightful training by Satish Dhawale, I’ve recently upskilled in:
 ✅ Advanced Excel
 ✅ VBA Coding
 ✅ Creating Personalized Add-ins
This project has deepened my understanding of automating reports and building user-friendly dashboards that enable quick decision-making.
If you're working on similar dashboards or exploring Excel’s full potential, let’s connect and share ideas
